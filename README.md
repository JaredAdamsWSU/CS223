# CS223
Compilation of my CS223 coding work.

Each branch contains a seperate programming assignment.

Each assignment was Developed on a linux system using linux commands and development environments.

All work was done using C++ and Makefiles.

On a linux machine to run the programs, simply navigate to the directory that contains the makefile and excecute "make test".

In the Dictionary assignment, in order to run the application excecute "make run" from the command line. "make test" and "make bigtest" will run high load tests on the program to test the data structures stability.
